# Heart Disease Prediction System

## Project Overview

The **Heart Disease Prediction System** is a machine learning-based project developed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. The system utilizes health metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other vital indicators to predict whether a person has heart disease or not. This prediction is achieved through a Logistic Regression model trained on a dataset of individuals' health information.

The project provides a user-friendly interface built using **Tkinter** that allows users to input their health data and receive an instant prediction of their heart disease status. It also visualizes relevant health metrics using **Matplotlib**, making it not only a functional prediction tool but also a valuable tool for visual analysis.

## Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: Developed using **Tkinter**, allowing users to easily input health data for prediction.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Utilizes a trained **Logistic Regression model** to predict heart disease based on user input.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize key health metrics with **Matplotlib** charts.
- **Easy-to-Understand Results**: Displays predictions and relevant health metrics in a clear and informative format.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Provides predictions as soon as the user enters their data and clicks "Analyze."

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used to develop the system.
- **Tkinter**: Python GUI library used to create the interactive user interface.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used to train the Logistic Regression model for heart disease prediction.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library used to handle and process the dataset.
- **NumPy**: A library used for numerical computing and handling large multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
